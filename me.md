Hi!  My name is Ryan and my friends call me Ryjo.

I'm a software developer living in Los Angeles. I have interests in music, learning, sensory perception and cognition, photography, sports, and games.  Musically, I have a special affinity for experimental/psych indie music and early 20th century classical. I drink Soylent.
