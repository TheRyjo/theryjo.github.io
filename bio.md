![Me]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/bio/me.jpg)

 Hi!  My name is Ryan and some call me Ryjo.  I'm a former rower and current software engineer living in Los Angeles. I have interests in music, learning, sensory perception and cognition, photography, sports, and games.  Musically, I have a special affinity for experimental/psych indie music and early 20th century classical. Yes, I do like Soylent.
  
  I currently work at Ingenico Mobile Solutions building payment solutions.
