__[Towing Guide](https://www.ford.com/trucks/towing-guide/)__ is a responsive application to view and filter vehicles by their towing capacities.

Towing Guide was conceived, designed, and implemented by Mavice as a means to provide customers streamlined access to towing data present in Ford's physical and digital brochures. It also demonstrated capabilities related to data-driven applications and Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) [SPA Editable Components](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-64/developing/headless/spas/spa-overview.html?lang=en).

Contributions:
- Back-end data mapping and API
- Front-end refactoring, fixes, and refinements
- Dynamic disclosures engine
